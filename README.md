## Dynamic Sales Insights Dashboard: Navigating Growth

In this BI report, I initiated by importing datasets and performing comprehensive data cleaning. Vital data measures and calculated columns were added to enhance analysis capabilities. Subsequently, I established relationships among geography, product, sales, sales rep, sub-category, and date tables. The creation of a date data set further facilitated dynamic time-based analysis.

The dashboard, designed for insightful visualization, offers filters for country selection and year filtering. Additionally, a slicer enables month-wise refinement. The dashboard is enriched with KPI cards indicating total revenue, gross profit, and the sum of units. Visual insights are provided through pie charts representing total revenue based on sub-category and category.

The waterfall chart illustrates the cumulative total revenue trend across years and product names. A bar chart showcases the summed cross profit, categorized by product and category names. For performance trends, a line chart depicts total revenue's quarter-over-quarter growth and total profit's month-over-month growth by quarter.

This dashboard empowers users to navigate and gain valuable insights into revenue, profit, and growth trends, enabling informed decision-making across diverse aspects of the business.
