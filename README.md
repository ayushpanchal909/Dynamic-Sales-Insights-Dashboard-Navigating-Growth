In this BI report, I initiated by importing datasets and performing comprehensive data cleaning. Vital data measures and calculated columns were added to enhance analysis capabilities. Subsequently, I established relationships among geography, product, sales, sales rep, sub-category, and date tables. The creation of a date data set further facilitated dynamic time-based analysis.

The dashboard, designed for insightful visualization, offers filters for country selection and year filtering. Additionally, a slicer enables month-wise refinement. The dashboard is enriched with KPI cards indicating total revenue, gross profit, and the sum of units. Visual insights are provided through pie charts representing total revenue based on sub-category and category.

The waterfall chart illustrates the cumulative total revenue trend across years and product names. A bar chart showcases the summed cross profit, categorized by product and category names. For performance trends, a line chart depicts total revenue's quarter-over-quarter growth and total profit's month-over-month growth by quarter.

This dashboard empowers users to navigate and gain valuable insights into revenue, profit, and growth trends, enabling informed decision-making across diverse aspects of the business.

### Objective

>Which categories and sub-categories contribute the most to the total revenue

>How does the distribution of gross profit vary across different product names and sub-categories, as represented by the stacked columns chart?

> What are the trends in annual total revenue for different product names, as shown in the waterfall chart?

>How does the total revenue trend over time correlate with the quarterly growth rates?

What is the relationship between total profit's month-over-month growth and the overall total profit trend
